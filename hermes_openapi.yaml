    # Introduction
    Welcome to Ubble's API documentation !

    This API enables you to build a seamless identity verification experience for your customers.

    # Before you start

    ## Authentication
    We use both mutual TLS and basic authentication. You must then authenticate your calls by including your secret credentials as well as your client certificate and key in API requests.

    Make sure you have an account with us. Once you've signed in, navigate to Organisation > Credentials and create your credential and certificates.

    Your credentials and certificates carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure. Do not share your secret API keys or API certificates in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

    ## Webhook
    You will also need to define a webhook when generating an identity verification. It will enable you to be notified of each event, and to get the results of the verification when it is completed.

    For security reason all our webhook calls are signed, can be whitelisted or can even request an authentication. You will find all details about webhook implementation in the dedicated section.

    ## Redirect URL
    Finally you will need to provide a redirect URL. This URL will be used to redirect the applicant at the end of the verification. You will find more details on the way to manage applicant return in the dedicated section.

    # Get Started
    This section describes the easiest way to integrate our API. At the end of this section you will be able to create and get the results of identity verification.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kenji-ubble/kenji-ubble/main/doc_diagram.png)

    ## Step 1 : Request an identity verification
    This first step is to request an identity verification.

    You will have to include the declared first name and last name of the applicant in you call, as well as the webhook and redirect URL you should have prepared before. All the details to create an identity verification can be found in the endpoint section.

    The call will return an identity verification object. It will include the unique identifier of the identity verification, and we strongly advice you to store it in your backend because you will need it to get the detailed results.

    ## Step 2 : Redirect the applicant
    The identity verification object also includes the link you will have to use to redirect applicants to our web application.

    At this step, we strongly advice you to use web redirection. We've built an integration example showcasing how to integrate Ubble in a web app: [ubble-express-integration](https://github.com/ubbleai/integration_examples/tree/master/web).

    All the details to use another integration can be found in the technical integration section.

    ## Step 3 : Manage the applicant return
    When applicants terminate the verification, they are redirected to the redirect_url you have defined when creating the identity verification.

    The verification process can be synchronous or asynchronous, and so the results may not be available when the applicant is redirected. At this step, we advice you to create a waiting page.

    All the details to manage the applicant return can be found in the applicant return section.

    ## Step 4 : Make your decision
    Thanks to the webhook you have defined you will be notified of each event regarding the identity verification.

    The webhook body will include the event type as well as the `status` of the identity verification. At this step, you should wait for the `status` to be one of `approved`, `declined` or `retry_required`.

    If the `status` is `approved`, you should accept the applicant request.

    If the `status` is `declined`, you should refuse it.

    If the `status` is `retry_required`, you should request a retry and to redirect the applicant on the new link you will get. All the detail to request a retry can be found in the endpoint section.

    All the details about the identity verification results can be found in the dedicated section.

    ## Step 5 : Get the detailed results
    You may have to get the detailed results, particularly when the verification is `approved`.

    All the details to retrieve an identity verification can be found in the endpoint section. You will only need the unique identifier you got when creating the identity verification.

    You can also get these results in a pdf format through dedicated endpoint.

    # Web application integration
    As mentioned in the get started, applicants should be redirected toward our web application to perform the verification. In this section you will find all the information you need to make this redirection as seamless as possible.

    ## User journey customization
    To properly integrate the identity verification, you should customize the user journey with your solution engineer. You will be able to define : colors, logo, font, button radius and introduction sentence as detailed here : [Customize your Ubble experience](https://www.ubble.ai/en/custom-experience/).

    If you need it, you can create several user journey. They will all be linked to your organisation and you will have to define the user_journey_id when creating an identity verification.

    ## Technical integration

    ### Web Redirection
    You can redirect applicant using web redirection. We support all the major browsers current versions.

    We've built an integration example showcasing how to integrate Ubble in a web app:

    - [ubble-express-integration](https://github.com/ubbleai/integration_examples/tree/master/web)

    Web Redirection is compatible with the following browsers / OS. We do not ensure the compatibility of our service with beta versions of browsers / OS.

    | Desktop      | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Internet Explorer | Edge | Opera |
    |--------------|--------|---------|--------|-------------------|------|-------|
    | Min. Version | ≥ 53   | ≥ 52    | ≥ 11.1 | -                 | ≥ 16 | ≥ 58  |

    | Android      | Chrome for Android | Firefox for Android | Samsung Internet | IE Mobile |
    |--------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------|
    | Min. Version | ≥ 73               | ≥ 66                | ≥ 6.2            | -         |

    | iOS          | Safari Mobile | Chrome | All other browsers |
    |--------------|---------------|--------|--------------------|
    | Min. Version | ≥ 11.0        | ≥ 14.3 | -                  |

    To integrate Ubble in your website, create an identity verification in your backend, pass the URL to your web app and simply add it as a link :

    ```html
      <a href="`${identificationUrl}`"></a>
    ````

    ### Webview integration
    For a more integrated user experience in your mobile application, you can redirect the applicant using a webview.

    Here is the list of integration examples that we've built for you :

    - [iOS >= 13](https://github.com/ubbleai/integration_examples/tree/master/ios), on **iOS >= 14.3** WebRTC features work perfectly inside the [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview).
    - [android - webview version >= 53](https://github.com/ubbleai/integration_examples/tree/master/android)
    - [react-native - react-native webview >= 8.0](https://github.com/ubbleai/integration_examples/tree/master/UbbleReactNative)

    On iOS <= 12, due to limited webview compatibility, Ubble verification process must be completed in Safari App.

    For iOS Native you will have to open safari using the open method:

    ```swift
    UIApplication.shared.open(identificationUrl, options: [:])
    ```

    ### Flutter

    If you wish to use Ubble with Flutter, you can use the [flutter_inappwebview](https://inappwebview.dev/docs/).

    Make sure to follow the [WebRTC API](https://inappwebview.dev/docs/webrtc-api/) section of the documentation to ensure we're able to launch a video stream.

    ### Applicant return
    Applicants are redirected to the redirect URL you defined when they terminated the journey. In webview integration, we are expecting a deeplink to redirect the applicant on your mobile application. 

    The return is associated with an event that you will find both in the webhook notification and as a parameter in the redirect URL. 

    Example of redirect URL:

    `?id=123&event=capture_abortion&reason_codes=[1201]`

    This event can be: 

    - `capture_completion`: the applicant has completed the capture. 

    In this case you will have to wait for the next event to make you decision. You can either ask applicants to perform additional checks, or make them wait until results are available. 

    Please also note that in some cases the `check_completion` event can occur almost simultaneously, and consequently the results can be available when the applicant is redirected. 

    - `capture_abortion`:  the applicant terminated the capture without completing it. 

    In this case we advice you to request a retry. See the dedicated section to implement it. 

    - `capture_refusal`: the applicant explicitly refused to perform the capture. 

    In this case we advice you to propose an alternative to the applicant. 

    ### Iframe integration
    When using the Desktop-to-Mobile redirection flow, we recommend that you use our Iframe integration on **desktop** described below:

    Include the SDK as a script tag.

    If you need an example of Iframe usage, you can use our [iframe tester](https://ubbleai.github.io/iframe-tester/)

    ```JS
    <script
      src="https://cdn.ubble.ai/iframe-sdk-0.0.3.js"
      type="application/javascript"
    ></script>
    ```

    We expect your page to implement a global method `onUbbleReady` that will be triggered when the SDK is loaded

    ```JS
    function onUbbleReady() {}
    ```

    Initialize a new Ubble IDV object:

    ```JS
    function onUbbleReady() {
      const ubbleIDV = new Ubble.IDV(document.getElementById("ubble"), options);
    }
    ```

    ### API

    `elementId`: string | Element
    ```JS
    new Ubble.IDV("ubble", options);
    new Ubble.IDV(document.getElementById("ubble"), options);
    ```

    `options` Object
    - `width`: Iframe width in px
    - `height`: Iframe height in px
    - `allowCamera`: Boolean, indicating whether you want to capture video inside the iframe. This field should be false if you redirect the applicants via Desktop-to-Mobile redirection
    - `identificationUrl`: Identification url (e.g. Ubble ) events:
    - `onComplete(completeEvent)`: Event triggered when the applicant completes the identification

    ```json
    {
      "status": "processing",
      "redirectUrl": "https://your-redirect-url.com?identification_id=<ubble identification id>"
    }
    ```

    - `onAbort(abortEvent)`: Event triggered when the applicant aborts the identification

    ```json
    {
      "status": "aborted",
      "returnReason": "NO_DOCUMENT",
      "redirectUrl": "https://your-redirect-url.com?identification_id=<ubble identification id>"
    }
    ```

    - onExpired: Event triggered when the applicant's identification has expired

    ```json
    {
      "status": "expired",
      "redirectUrl": "https://your-redirect-url.com?identification_id=<ubble identification id>"`
    }
    ```


    ### Methods

    `destroy()`

    ```JS
    const ubbleIDV = new Ubble.IDV("id", {
      events: {
        onComplete(event) {
          console.log(`Done with ubble flow: ${event}`);
          ubbleIDV.destroy();
        },
      },
    });
    ```

    ### Full example

    ```JS
    const ubbleIDV = new Ubble.IDV("idv", {
      width: "500",
      height: "600",
      allowCamera: true,
      identificationUrl: "https://id.ubble.ai/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
      events: {
        onComplete(event) {
          ubbleIDV.destroy();
        },
        onAbort(event) {
          ubbleIDV.destroy();
        },
        onExpired(event) {
          ubbleIDV.destroy();
        }
      },
    });
    ```

    ### Known Issues

    - Make sure you did not forget to add a semicolon in the header `Content-Security-Policy: frame-src https://*.domain_name.fr;`
    - Make sure beforehand the use of the camera has been allowed

    ## Mobile redirection
    Both for security reason and because it improves the conversion rate, we redirect all applicants from desktop to mobile. Nevertheless we ensure a synchronisation between desktop and mobile to redirect applicants to their desktop at the end of the journey.

    Applicants can use either QR code or SMS sending to perform this redirection. To make the SMS redirection smoother, you can send us the phone number of the applicant when creating an identity verification : we use it to prefill the associated field during the redirection. Fore more details see the identity verification endpoint.

    ## Lifecycle

    To make your decision you should mainly use events and status. This information is directly available in the webhook body.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kenji-ubble/kenji-ubble/main/life%20cycle%20diagram.png)

    ## Events

    An event is a change in the verification lifecycle that triggers a notification.

    | Events             | Description                                                                |
    |--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | creation           | You created an identity verification                                       |
    | start              | The applicant has been redirected to the web application                   |
    | capture_completion | The applicant completed the capture                                        |
    | checks_completion  | We completed the checks                                                    |
    | expiration         | The link expired without applicant being redirected to the web application |
    | capture_refused    | The applicant explicitly refused to perform the verification               |
    | capture_abortion   | The applicant terminated the capture without completing it                 |
    | checks_failure     | We tried to complete the checks without success                            |
    | retry_requested    | You requested a retry for this identity verification                       |

    ## Status

    The status is defined by the position of the verification in the lifecycle and indicates the decision to make. 

    | Status              | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
    |---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | pending             | The identity verification is available,  you should redirect the applicant to the web application using the link.                                                               |
    | capture_in_progress | The applicant is performing the capture,  you should wait for status change.                                                                                                    |
    | checks_in_progress  | We are performing the checks,  you should wait for status change.                                                                                                               |
    | approved            | All checks are valid,  you should accept to the applicant request.                                                                                                              |
    | declined            | An irregularity has been detected when performing checks, You should refuse the applicant request.  You can allow applicant to try again later by creating a new verification.  |
    | retry_required      | We could not perform all the checks, you should request a retry for this identity verification.                                                                                 |
    | refused             | The applicant refused to perform the verification,  you should propose an alternative.                                                                                          |

    ## Reason codes

    When the status is retry_required, declined or refused you will also get additional information in the webhook body with the reason_codes. You will find below the exhaustive list of reason_codes. 

    > **warning:** Please note that we consider adding new reason codes as backward compatible. 
    > You should then build you business rules on status and use reason codes as additional information, rather than use reason codes as required information.

    ## Retry management 
    When the status of the identity verification is retry_required we advice you to request a retry. You will need the identity_verification_id, as well as a webhook and a redirect URL. 

    All information to request a retry can be found in the endpoint section. 

    We strongly advice you to use the reason_codes to guide the applicant toward success. For example, if the reason codes indicate that the connection of the applicant is not sufficient, you should give this information to the applicant. 

    <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; background-color: #fff6d9; border-color: #f8c92e; color: #666; display: flex; align-items: center;">
      <div style="margin-right: 10px; font-size: 24px; color: #f8c92e;">⚠️</div>
      <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: top;">
        <p>Please note that you cannot request a retry if the status is declined. If you still want to onboard the concerned applicant, you should request a new verification and indicate the applicant_id. For more details see the applicant section.</p>

    ## Detailed results

    ### Retrieve an identification

    If you need, you can get the full results by using the retrieve an identity verification endpoint. It will mainly include the following information:

    | Attribute    | Description                                                                                                    |
    |--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | status       | Indicates the position in the lifecycle as well as the action to be taken                                      |
    | reason_codes | Indicates the cause when the status is refused, declined or retry_required                                     |
    | identity     | Includes all information about the identity of the applicant                                                   |
    | document     | Includes all information that has been extracted from the document, as well as the best images of the document |
    | face         | Includes the best image of the face                                                                            |
    | pdf          | Includes all information in a pdf format                                                                       |

    Please note that the information we extract from the document can be configured with your solution engineer.

    ### API response signing
    If enabled in your configuration (Contact your account manager in order to activate the response signature), Ubble API responses will be signed. This signature can be used to verify that the api response has not been altered and has been issued by Ubble and not by anyone else. To also verify that assets data (images) has not been altered and comes from Ubble, the assets hash has been added to the response body, and after verification of the signature, the images can be hashed and compared to the hashes in the verified response. Ubble uses an asymetric key signing algorithm of type ECDSA with a sha2-512 hashing algorithm. Assets are hashed using the sha2-256 hashing algorithm.

    #### Signing key policy
    A signing key will be created for each configuration and for each environment (Live and Test). The public key (used for signature verification) associated with the private key that is managed by ubble can be downloaded from the client dashboard. The private key has a validity of 1 year and will be automatically renewed. Upon renewal the public key will also change and has to be re-downloaded from the dashboard. You can detect a key rotation by looking at the signature version in the api response, to verify that response you will need to use the public key with the same version. All versions of the public key can be downloaded from the dashboard so you don't have to worry about losing older versions.

    #### Verifying Response signature

    The `Ubble-Signature` header contains the timestamp of the request (`1635236316.377888`), the signing key identifier and version (`3456-live-v1`) as well as the signature itself (`5257a869a7ecebeda35affa62cdcb3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff546d0ae8e108d8bd`).

    format:
    ```
      <timestamp>:<configuration id>-<test or live identification>-<key version>:<signature>
    ```

    example:
    ```
      1635236316.377888:3456-live-v1:5257a869a7ecebeda35affa62cdcb3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff546d0ae8e108d8bd
    ```

    The signature can be verified on your side by verifying the signature against the received body using the `public key` corresponding to the signature key. You will need the Public key corresponding to the signature version, that you can find on your dashboard configuration page. There is one for test identifications and one for live identifications.

    See the example in python if you need help.

    #### Verifying Assets
    To verify that the assets that correspond to the received response are correct, the received images have to be hashed using a specific algorithm, this hash must be the same as the hash that was sent with the signed response.

    Be aware that all two verification stages must be valid (api response signature and assets hash) for the data to be valid.

    ## Data management
    You can define with your solution engineer the data storage time, in accordance with your purpose for using the data. At the end of this time, the identity verifications are anonymized, what means that all fields consider as personal or sensitive data are deleted.

    If needed, you can also request the anonymization of an identity verification through the dedicated endpoint. 

    # Applicants

    ## Creation
    When you create an identity verification, an applicant is automatically created and the call returns an `applicant_id`. 

    You can also directly create an applicant using the dedicated endpoint. In this case you will be able to define the `external_applicant_id`, that should correspond to unique identifier of the applicant in your database, as well as the `mail` of the applicant. 

    If the applicant is already created, you can also patch this information using the dedicated endpoint. 

    ## Applicant file 
    You can request several verifications for the same applicant. You only need to indicate the concerned `applicant_id` when creating the verification. 

    If and only if an identity verification is `approved`, the verified identity is added to the applicant file and you can find this information using the retrieve an applicant endpoint. 

    # Webhooks

    ## Configuration
    You need to define the webhook you want to be notified on when creating an identity verification. You will be notified of each event on identity verifications. For more details see the event section. 

    To help you integrate your webhook you can trigger it with the standard answers, see [notify endpoint](#tag/identity-verifications/operation/notify_identity_verification).

    ## Retry
    We expect that you return us a 200 or 201 status code within 10 seconds before we retry, up to 2 retries will be performed. If needed, webhook notifications can be resend manually using the [notify endpoint](#tag/identity-verifications/operation/notify_identity_verification).

    ## Body 
    The webhook body contains the following information: 

    | Attribute                | Description                                   |
    |--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
    | applicant_id             | id of the applicant, useful to recognize them |
    | user_journey_id          | id of the user journey                        |
    | identity_verification_id | id of the identity verification               |
    | status                   | status of the identity verification           |
    | reason_codes             | list of reason codes                          |

    ## Signature
    For security reason all our webhook calls are signed.

    `Ubble-Signature` header contains the timestamp of the signature plus the signature itself. This allow you to ensure the content of the webhook was not modified.

    The timestamp is prefixed by `ts=`, and the signature is prefixed by `v1=`. Example: `ts=1492774577,v1=5257a869e7ecebeda32affa62cdca3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff536d0ce8e108d8bd`

    To compare the signature, you will need the `webhook secret`, that you can find on your dashboard configuration page. There is one for secret for test identifications and one for live identifications.

    See the example in python if you need help.

    ## Security
    ### Webhook ip whitelisting
    For security purposes, if you need to whitelist our incoming api calls, see our [public ip](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/OUTSCALE-Public-IPs.html).

    ### Webhooks Authentication
    You can also choose to authentify our webhook calls against OAuth2. Please contact your solution engineer in order set up the authentication. You will need to provide an URL Token, a `CLIENT_ID`, a `CLIENT_SECRET` and optionnally a refresh token URL.

    # API standards

    ## Required tag
    ### required
    Attributes tagged as `required` **MUST** be present in requests and reponses.

    ### null values
    Attributes not marked as `required` can be null. In that case the attribute is not sent in the response.

    ## Ressources identifiers
    ### Format
    `{prefix}_{lower-case base-32 encoded GUID}`

    ### Ressources identifiers are formatted as follows

    | ressource name         | prefix | example                         |
    |------------------------|--------|---------------------------------|
    | applicants             | apl    | apl_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we  |

    | user-journey           | usj    | usj_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we  |

    ## Content type
    The API accepts and returns `application/json` type.

    ## Error handling
    Errors 4xx and 5xx are formatted as follows:
    - `error_type`: a short descirption code
    - `error_codes`: a list of more detailed codes

    Error codes and error types can be formatted as follows:
    - `{target/attribute}__{error}`
    - `{nested_object}__{object_attribute}__{error}`

    ```json
    {
      "error_type": "invalid_request",
